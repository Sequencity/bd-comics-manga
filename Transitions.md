# Transitions

Visual narratives are sequences of "pages",
and transitions appear when the reader moves from page to page.

A page may be the scan of a traditional comics page, or a single turbomedia image. 

On touch devices, transitions are driven by the movement of the user's finger; the transition speed is driven by the movement speed.  

## Different types of transitions
Here is a first list of useful transitions, most of them being implemented in PowerPoint and the likes. 

### Cross-fade 
The next page fades in as the current page fades out.

### Slide-in/out (or Push)
The next page appears first on a corner, right, left, top or bottom, then pushes the current page to the other corner. 

### Wipe
The next page appears first on a corner, right, left, top or bottom, then spreads to the other corner, as the current slide fades. 

### Split
The next page appears first on the center, on a vertical or horizontal axis, then spreads to the corners, as the current slide fades.

### Animations in-between pages
Some image resources are displayed between the current and next page. 

##  CSS transitions
Most transitions (but animations in-between pages) will be implemented as CSS 3 transitions (https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transitions-1/).
